      </h3>
      <p>
        CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial
        websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law’s reach
        stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the
        United States (and conceivable the world) that operates websites
        collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers
        to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the
        information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being
        shared, and to comply with this policy.
      </p>
      <p>According to CalOPPA we agree to the following:</p>
